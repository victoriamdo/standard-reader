# Standard Reader — TODO

Derived from [`APP_VISION.md`](./APP_VISION.md). Organized toward the **v1 milestone**, then later
work. Check items off as they land.

---

## 0. Foundation & infra

- [x] Confirm TanStack Start + hip-ui + StyleX baseline runs (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`).
- [x] Set up env management (`.env` for `DATABASE_URL`, AT Proto OAuth secrets, tap config) + `.env.example`.
- [x] Confirm Neon project + connection (`src/db/index.ts`) and Drizzle migration flow (`drizzle.config.ts`, `drizzle/`).
- [x] Decide deployment target (Node server output) and wire CI for lint/format/typecheck/build (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## 1. Data ingestion — tap → Neon

- [x] Stand up the **tap instance** to backfill all `standard.site` data from the network
      (`tap/` — docker-compose for `bluesky-social/indigo` cmd/tap, signal collection
      `site.standard.publication`, filters `site.standard.*` + `app.bsky.actor.profile`, webhook
      delivery to `/api/ingest/tap`; `tap/README.md` runbook + `tap/seed-repos.sh`).
- [x] Keep the read-model in sync (tap firehose + backfill; consumer expands tracking along the
      graph via tap `/repos/add` when it sees contributor/subscription/recommend references).
- [x] Operational basics: cursor persistence (tap-owned) + `ingest_state` high-water mark;
      retry/backoff (tap) + idempotent upserts + `ingest_dead_letter`; `/api/ingest/status`
      observability + structured logs.
- [x] Topic derivation: `recomputeTopics()` sets each publication's `topic` to its most
      frequent document tag (lexicon has no topic field).
- [x] Local-dev run verified end-to-end via the **real tap pipeline** against a local Postgres:
- [x] Local-dev run verified end-to-end via the **real tap pipeline** against a local Postgres:
      `tap/` docker-compose → acknowledged WebSocket channel → standalone ingest worker
      (`pnpm ingest:dev`) → consumer → `standard_reader` db. `src/db/index.ts` is driver-aware
      (node-postgres for local URLs, Neon serverless for Neon; override `DB_DRIVER`). Backfilled
      5k+ pubs / 60k+ docs / 5k+ subs / 8k+ profiles. The ingest worker, not the TanStack app
      server, owns tap event processing, operational status, and recompute endpoints.
- [ ] _Later:_ schedule the derived-data `recompute` cron; publication verification pass
      (`/.well-known/site.standard.publication`).

## 2. Read-model schema (Drizzle)

- [x] Replace `demo_users` placeholder with real tables (`src/db/schema/`, migration `0000`,
      applied to Neon).
- [x] `publications` (`site.standard.publication`: uri/cid/did, name, url, description, icon blob,
      flattened `basicTheme`, `showInDiscover`, app-derived `topic`, verification state).
- [x] `documents` (`site.standard.document`: uri, publication ref + raw `site`, title, path,
      canonical URL, description, `content`/`textContent`, cover image blob, tags, app-derived
      `featured`, `bskyPostRef`, published/updated) + `document_contributors`.
- [x] `profiles` — author/contributor identity backfilled from Bluesky (`app.bsky.actor.profile`
  - identity layer): did, handle, pds, display name, bio, avatar/banner (standard.site has no
    profile lexicon).
- [x] `subscriptions` (`site.standard.graph.subscription`: subscriber DID → publication) +
      `recommends` (`site.standard.graph.recommend`: recommender DID → document) — for social proof
  - recommendations.
- [x] Derived/aggregate tables for **trending** and **recommendations**: `publication_stats`
      (counts, freshness, rolling-window velocity, trending score) + `publication_cosubscriptions`
      (co-subscription similarity). Recomputed via `src/server/ingest/recompute.ts`.
- [x] Indexes for feed, directory sort (Readers / Active / A–Z), and search (GIN `tsvector` on
      documents + publications).
- [x] Generate + run migrations (`drizzle/0000_premium_gorgon.sql`).

## 3. Auth — AT Proto / Bluesky OAuth

- [ ] Implement OAuth sign-in flow (handle/PDS resolution, callback, session).
- [ ] Persist session; expose current user **DID** to server functions + UI.
- [ ] Sign-out + session refresh handling.
- [ ] Guard personal views (Home/Latest unread, bookmarks) on auth state.

## 4. Lexicons & writes (records = source of truth)

- [ ] Define app-owned lexicons under `app.standard-reader`:
  - [ ] `app.standard-reader.bookmark`
  - [ ] `app.standard-reader.readState`
- [x] Confirm `standard.site` subscription lexicon shape: `site.standard.graph.subscription`
      (`publication` at-uri + optional `createdAt`); read-model ingests it. Write path TODO below.
- [ ] Write path: create/delete records in the user's repo for follow / bookmark / readState.
- [ ] Optimistic cache update on write; reconcile from repo/firehose.

## 5. Data layer (server functions)

- [ ] Feed queries: Home (featured lead + latest unread + rails), Latest (All / Unread + counts).
- [ ] Directory queries: All publications (topic chips, sort, pagination) for Discover.
- [ ] Publication profile query (header, recent writing, readers-also-follow).
- [ ] Article query (content + mark-read on open).
- [ ] Search: publications + articles split.
- [ ] Handle resolution: AT Proto handle/domain → publication preview (for Add modal).

## 6. Discovery engine (network-powered)

- [ ] **Recommended for you** — collaborative filtering over the follow graph (co-subscription).
- [ ] **Followed by people you follow** — social-graph query.
- [ ] **Trending publications / Trending now** — recent activity (new articles + follow velocity, rolling window).
- [ ] **Cold start** fallback to overall popularity when user has no follows.

## 7. UI — port screens to TanStack Start + hip-ui

Build each on hip-ui components + StyleX tokens (no raw HTML/inline styles).

- [ ] App shell: desktop persistent left sidebar; mobile top bar + bottom tab nav; Following list.
- [ ] **Home** — masthead (date + unread count), featured lead, latest unread rows, right rail (Trending + You might follow).
- [ ] **Latest** — chronological list, segmented All/Unread filter with counts.
- [ ] **Discover** — Recommended / Followed-by-people-you-follow / Trending / All (chips, sort, grid⇄list toggle).
- [ ] **Search** — editorial field, live results split into Publications + Articles.
- [ ] **Article** (reading view) — ~680px measure, drop-cap, pull quotes, hero, sticky bar (back/byline/follow/save/share), reading-progress bar, footer pub card + "More from {publication}".
- [ ] **Publication profile** — banner + inline header (avatar/topic/name/desc/stats/Copy DID/Follow), recent writing, right rail (About + DID + readers-also-follow), social proof line.
- [ ] **Add / Follow modal** — Browse / Paste a handle (resolve → preview → follow) / Search tabs.
- [ ] Global follow toggle reflects everywhere instantly (optimistic).
- [ ] Theme tokens / dark mode parity with prototype.

## 8. Routing & state

- [ ] URL-backed routes for home / latest / discover / search / article / publication (TanStack Router).
- [ ] Real back/forward + shareable/deep links.
- [ ] Replace prototype's in-memory view stack.

## 9. v1 polish & QA

- [ ] Loading / empty / error states for all data-backed views.
- [ ] Responsive checks (desktop + mobile breakpoints).
- [ ] Accessibility pass (react-aria props, keyboard nav, focus).
- [ ] Vitest coverage on data-layer + key components.
- [ ] Lint/format/typecheck/build all green.

---

## Later (post-v1)

- [ ] Recommendation / trending tuning and quality.
- [ ] Higher-quality full-text search.
- [ ] Offline / save-for-later.
- [ ] Notifications.
- [ ] Multi-account.

## Non-goals (for now)

- Read-first client: **no** commenting, posting, or authoring publications in-app.
