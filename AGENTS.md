## Skill Loading

Before editing files for a substantial task:

- Run `pnpm dlx @tanstack/intent@latest list` from the workspace root to see available local skills.
- If a listed skill matches the task, run `pnpm dlx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>` before changing files.
- Use the loaded `SKILL.md` guidance while making the change.
- Monorepos: when working across packages, run the skill check from the workspace root and prefer the local skill for the package being changed.
- Multiple matches: prefer the most specific local skill for the package or concern you are changing; load additional skills only when the task spans multiple packages or concerns.

# Project Context

A blank [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) (React) application. No partner add-ons or
extra feature scaffolding were selected — this is the default blank React starter.

**Package manager: pnpm** (`pnpm@10.26.0`, pinned via `package.json#packageManager`). The project
was scaffolded with npm and later switched to pnpm: `package-lock.json` was removed and
`pnpm-lock.yaml` is the committed lockfile. Use `pnpm` for all installs/scripts.

## Living docs — keep these current as we work

This repo has two source-of-truth planning docs that **must be kept up to date as work happens**:

- [`APP_VISION.md`](./APP_VISION.md) — the product vision (concept, architecture, scope). When a
  decision changes the product direction, data model, lexicons, or architecture, **update
  `APP_VISION.md` in the same change** so it never drifts from reality.
- [`TODO.md`](./TODO.md) — the actionable roadmap derived from the vision. As you complete work,
  **check off the relevant items**; when scope changes or new work is discovered, **add/adjust
  items**. Keep `TODO.md` in sync with `APP_VISION.md`.

Treat updating these docs as part of "done" for any meaningful change, not an afterthought.

## How this project was scaffolded

The project was created with the TanStack CLI, then the generated output was merged into this
repository (which already contained `.git`, `.cursor/`, and a generic `.gitignore`).

```bash
# 1. Scaffold (run in a scratch directory, then merged into this repo root)
npx @tanstack/cli@latest create my-tanstack-app --agent

# 2. TanStack Intent (run in this repo root, after merge + install)
npx @tanstack/intent@latest install   # wires skill-loading guidance into this AGENTS.md
npx @tanstack/intent@latest list      # lists installed, loadable skills

# 3. Switched the package manager from npm to pnpm
rm package-lock.json node_modules -rf
pnpm install                          # generates pnpm-lock.yaml
```

- CLI version resolved: `@tanstack/cli@0.69.0` (via `@latest`).
- Intent version resolved: `@tanstack/intent@0.0.41` (via `@latest`).
- Effective scaffold config (`.cta.json`): `framework: react`, `mode: file-router`,
  `typescript: true`, `tailwind: true`, `packageManager: pnpm`, `intent: true`, no add-ons
  (`chosenAddOns: []`). (`packageManager` was originally `npm`; switched to `pnpm`. `.cta.json`
  records `tailwind: true` as the original scaffold choice, but Tailwind has since been removed in
  favor of StyleX — see "Stack & integrations".)

> Note: the workspace was an essentially empty git repo (not a competing platform template), so
> nothing from the CLI output had to be dropped. Every generated integration, dependency, script,
> and config is represented in this repo.

## Stack & integrations

- **Framework:** TanStack Start + TanStack Router (file-based routing), React 19.
- **Build/toolchain (CLI default):** Vite 8, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `@tanstack/router-plugin`.
- **Design system:** [hip-ui](https://hip-ui.tngl.io) — a copy-and-own, StyleX + react-aria
  component library vendored into `src/design-system/`. **Build UI from these components and
  tokens** (see "Design system" below).
- **Styling:** StyleX (`@stylexjs/stylex`) is the only styling layer, compiled by
  `@stylexjs/unplugin` in `vite.config.ts`. **Tailwind has been removed** (no `@tailwindcss/vite`,
  `tailwindcss`, or `@tailwindcss/typography`, and `styles.css` is now just a tiny reset). Build all
  UI from design-system components + StyleX tokens.
- **Devtools:** `@tanstack/react-devtools` + `@tanstack/devtools-vite` (stripped from production
  builds automatically).
- **Icons:** `lucide-react` (used by the starter Header/Footer/ThemeToggle).
- **Testing:** Vitest + Testing Library + jsdom (no tests authored yet).
- **Lint/format:** oxlint (oxc) + oxfmt — see "Linting & formatting" below.
- **Agent tooling:** TanStack Intent skill mappings (see the block at the top of this file).

## Design system (hip-ui) — use it for all UI

This project vendors the **hip-ui** design system into `src/design-system/` (a "copy-and-own"
StyleX + [react-aria-components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) library). When
building or changing UI, **use these components and tokens instead of hand-rolling markup, raw
HTML elements, or ad-hoc CSS / inline styles.**

### Rules

- **Prefer design-system components.** Import from `src/design-system/<component>` (aliases `#/` and
  `@/` both map to `./src`, e.g. `import { Button } from "#/design-system/button"`). Components are
  named exports built on react-aria, so they're accessible by default (use their props rather than
  re-implementing keyboard/ARIA behavior). Browse `src/design-system/*/index.tsx` for the catalog
  (Button, Card, Dialog, Flex, Grid, TextField, Select, Menu, Toast, etc.).
- **Use theme tokens, never hardcoded values.** Pull design tokens from the StyleX theme in
  `src/design-system/theme/` (re-exported from `src/design-system/theme/index.ts`): colors and
  `semantic-color`, `spacing` / `semantic-spacing` (`gap`), `radius`, `shadow`, `typography`,
  `animations` (`animationDuration`), and `media-queries`. Reference them in `stylex.create(...)`
  (e.g. `gap: gap["md"]`, `transitionDuration: animationDuration.fast`) instead of literal
  px/hex/duration values.
- **Never inline spacing values.** All spacing — `padding*`, `margin*`, `gap` / `rowGap` /
  `columnGap`, and spacing-derived `top`/`left`/`inset`/`width`/`height` for layout — MUST use a
  spacing token, never a literal (`"1.5rem"`, `12`, `"0.45rem"`, etc.). Use the semantic scales
  (`verticalSpace`/`horizontalSpace` for `padding`/`margin`, `gap` for gaps, `size` for
  icon/avatar boxes) where a step fits; fall back to the raw `spacing` scale
  (`spacing["12"]`) for steps the semantic scales don't cover. If a design genuinely needs an
  off-scale value, that's the rare "super necessary" exception — snap to the nearest token first,
  and only inline a literal with a comment explaining why no token fits.
- **Style with StyleX**, following the existing component conventions (`stylex.create` +
  `stylex.props`, `"use client"` where needed). Avoid introducing new Tailwind/inline styling for
  design-system work.
- **Layout tips (from hip-ui):** prefer `Flex` for layout (use `Grid` only for true 2D layouts) and
  **always set a `gap`**; text uses `text-box-trim`, so bump the flex `gap` around text; use `Card`
  sparingly.

### Use the hip-ui MCP server before building UI

The repo configures the hip-ui MCP server in `.cursor/mcp.json` (`npx hip-ui mcp` → server
`hip-ui-docs`). **Consult it before adding or significantly changing UI** so you follow the current,
shipped component patterns rather than guessing:

1. **Load the resource `hip-ui://tips-and-tricks-for-llms`** ("tips & tricks for LLMs") first and
   keep it in context.
2. **`list-sections`** — discover the available docs (introduction, foundations, components,
   showcase, ai).
3. **`get-documentation`** — fetch full markdown for the component/section you're working with
   (accepts a title, docs slug, or `/docs` URL path; single or array).

If the MCP server isn't connected, the same docs are vendored at
`node_modules/hip-ui/dist/mcp/docs/` and component source lives in `src/design-system/`.

### StyleX build wiring

StyleX is compiled by `@stylexjs/unplugin/vite` (first plugin in `vite.config.ts`, mirroring
`~/Documents/at-store`). The plugin is configured with `treeshakeCompensation`, `dev` toggled by
`NODE_ENV`, the `#/*` + `@/*` aliases pointing at `./src/*`, and `lightningcssOptions.targets`
derived from `browserslist("baseline 2024")` (via `lightningcss` + `browserslist`). In dev,
`__root.tsx` imports `virtual:stylex:runtime` and links `/virtual:stylex.css` (typed via
`src/stylex-env.d.ts`); the production build emits a real CSS asset. The StyleX-aware lint rules are
wired up too (see "Linting & formatting"). `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm typecheck`,
`pnpm build`, and `pnpm dev` all pass with the design system linted and in use.

## AT Protocol data model — never hit the PDS for reads

All AT Protocol record collections we care about are **mirrored into the Neon
read-model** (Postgres tables in `src/db/schema/`) by the tap ingester
(`src/server/ingest/`). The canonical records always live in each author's / reader's
repo on their PDS, but the DB mirror is the read path. **Never hit the PDS for a
read when data exists in the DB.**

### How it works

- **Tap ingester** (`src/server/ingest/consumer.ts` → `handlers.ts`): every
  `create`/`update`/`delete` event from the firehose upserts or deletes a DB row.
  Each collection has an `upsertX` handler and a `deleteRecord` case.
- **DB tables**: `publications`, `documents`, `subscriptions`, `recommends`,
  `reads`, `bookmarks`, `lists`, `list_saves`, `labeler_subscriptions`,
  `labeler_services`, `profiles`, etc. (see `src/db/schema.ts` for the full list).
- **Backfill** (`backfillXFromRepo` in `handlers.ts`): when no DB rows exist for a
  reader yet (first visit, pre-sync gap), the read path fetches from the PDS once,
  upserts into the DB, and then serves from the DB on subsequent reads.
- **Writes** (`putRecord` / `deleteRecord` / `applyWrites` in
  `src/server/atproto/repo-records.ts`): these **always** hit the PDS — the repo is
  the source of truth. After a successful write, the tap event mirrors the change
  into the DB. The DB row is never the write target.

### Rules

1. **Read from the DB, not the PDS.** If a collection has a DB table, read it from
   the DB. Do not use `listCollectionRecords` or `client.get("com.atproto.repo.*")`
   for reads when a DB table exists.
2. **Falling back to the PDS is OK** when no DB rows exist yet (first access for a
   repo). Always upsert what you fetch so the next read hits the DB. Use the
   `backfillXFromRepo` pattern.
3. **`fetchPublicList` / `listCollectionRecords` / `getRecord`** are only
   appropriate for: (a) backfill/fallback when the DB is empty, (b) collections
   that are genuinely not mirrored (none should exist — if you find one, add a
   table + ingest handler instead), or (c) third-party collections (Margin,
   Cosmik, Sifa, PCKT, Leaflet, Greengale) read via `fetchRepoRecordWithFallback`
   that have no DB mirror and never will.
4. **Delete operations read from the DB, then delete on the PDS.** The read step
   (enumerating what to delete) uses the DB; the actual `deleteRecord` call goes
   to the PDS. The DB row is cleaned up by the tap delete handler afterward.

## Scripts

- `pnpm install` — install dependencies.
- `pnpm dev` — Vite dev server on port 3000 (falls back to the next free port if taken).
- `pnpm build` — production build (client + SSR bundles into `dist/`).
- `pnpm preview` — preview the production build.
- `pnpm test` — run Vitest once.
- `pnpm typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`.
- `pnpm lint` — run oxlint over the repo.
- `pnpm format` — format the repo with oxfmt (writes changes).
- `pnpm format:check` — verify formatting without writing (CI-friendly).
- `pnpm check` — format, then `oxlint . --fix` (one-shot local cleanup).
- `pnpm fix-stylex-keys` — autofix StyleX `sort-keys` / `valid-shorthands` across `src` via
  `eslint.stylex-autofix.mjs` (oxlint reports these but can't autofix them). May need to be run a
  couple of times to converge on large objects.
- `pnpm db:generate` / `db:migrate` / `db:push` / `db:studio` — Drizzle Kit (schema in
  `src/db/schema.ts`, migrations in `drizzle/`).
- `pnpm lex:lint` / `pnpm atproto:publish-lexicons` — validate / publish the app-owned
  `app.standard-reader.*` lexicons in `./lexicons/` via the `goat` CLI
  (`scripts/goat-lex.mjs`; needs `LEXICON_PUBLISH_*` creds + `_lexicon.*` DNS).
- `pnpm perf:test` — Playwright load-regression suite (`perf/load-regression.spec.ts`); dev server
  must be running (`pnpm dev`). Writes JSON reports to `perf/results/` (`latest-guest.json`,
  `latest-signed-in.json`, `latest-comparison.json`).
- `pnpm perf:test:guest` / `pnpm perf:test:signed-in` — run one auth mode from the suite.
- `pnpm perf:view` — open the latest perf report in the browser.
- `pnpm perf:discover-fixtures` — refresh perf fixture paths (article/publication URLs in `.env`).

## Performance & tabbed routes

Load budgets live in `perf/lib/targets.ts`; results land in `perf/results/latest-comparison.json`
(guest vs signed-in on the same routes) plus per-mode `latest-{guest|signed-in}.json`. Fix perf
**one route at a time** and re-run `pnpm perf:test` (or a filtered grep target) so UX does not
regress.

Reference implementations:

- **Tabbed directory views:** `src/routes/_layout.tag.$tag.tsx`
- **Tabbed feed filters + idle prefetch:** `src/routes/_layout.latest.tsx`
- **Combined loader + cache seeding:** `src/integrations/tanstack-query/api-tag.functions.ts`
  (`getTagPage`, `seedTagPageCaches`)
- **Home feed — critical path + deferred extras:** `src/routes/_layout.index.tsx`,
  `src/integrations/tanstack-query/api-feed.functions.ts` (`getHomePage`, `loadHomeFeedCritical`,
  `getHomeExtras`, `loadHomeFeedExtras`)
- **Latest feed — critical path + deferred tab counts:** `src/routes/_layout.latest.tsx`,
  `src/integrations/tanstack-query/api-feed.functions.ts` (`getLatestFeed`, `loadLatestFeedCritical`,
  `getLatestFeedCounts`, `loadLatestFeedCounts`)
- **Discover — critical shell + deferred rails:** `src/routes/_layout.discover.tsx`,
  `src/integrations/tanstack-query/api-discover.functions.ts` (`getDiscoverExtras`,
  `loadDiscoverExtras`)

### Home feed: critical path + deferred extras

Not every server query belongs on the route loader. Split home into two tiers:

| Tier         | Server fn                              | What loads                                                                                                     | When                                         |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | `getHomePage` → `loadHomeFeedCritical` | Featured lead, latest rows, comment counts on those articles, scope toggle, masthead structure, section titles | Route loader (blocks first paint)            |
| **Deferred** | `getHomeExtras` → `loadHomeFeedExtras` | Unread count scan, Trending rail, “You might follow” rail                                                      | Client `useQuery` after critical feed paints |

Implementation notes:

- Critical feed returns `unreadCount: null`, empty `trending` / `youMightFollow`. Seed the home feed
  cache from the loader as today (`getHomeFeedQueryOptions`).
- Extras query key includes `scope` + `excludeUris` (featured + latest article URIs) so trending
  does not duplicate main-column articles.
- **Stable masthead:** do not substitute row length or other proxies for the unread count — copy
  jumps when the real count arrives. While the count is pending, use neutral dek text (no number)
  and skeleton the count badge / dek line until extras resolve.
- **Skeleton placeholders:** show skeletons in the slots deferred data fills — masthead count/dek
  and both rails (`HomeTrendingRailSkeleton`, `HomeYouMightFollowRailSkeleton`) while
  `extrasPending`. Rails keep their real section headers; only row content is skeletonized. Mark
  skeleton containers with `aria-busy="true"`.
- Deferred work must **not** sit on the page-level `aria-busy` chain — Playwright perf tests clear
  when the critical path is ready (`perf/lib/measure.ts`); extras loading afterward is intentional.
- **Loader cache priming:** after seeding the critical cache, kick off deferred queries in the route
  loader. On **navigation** (`preload: false`), `await ensureQueryData` for above-the-fold extras so
  masthead counts and rails resolve before paint. On **link-hover preload** (`preload: true`), use
  `void prefetchQuery(...)` only — warm the cache without blocking.

Reuse this split elsewhere when below-the-fold or badge counts can wait (e.g. Latest tab badge
counts — see below).

### Latest feed: critical path + deferred tab counts

Same tiered pattern as home, applied to `/latest`:

| Tier         | Server fn                                      | What loads                                       | When                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | `getLatestFeed` → `loadLatestFeedCritical`     | Active filter’s article rows + pagination cursor | Route loader / tab `useSuspenseQuery`                               |
| **Deferred** | `getLatestFeedCounts` → `loadLatestFeedCounts` | All four tab badge totals + masthead meta count  | Client `useQuery` (`["feed", "latest", "counts"]`) after rows paint |

Implementation notes:

- Critical feed returns `counts: null`. Pagination (`offset > 0`) never re-fetches counts.
- One shared counts query serves every tab — prefetch it once on idle alongside inactive tab feeds.
- **Stable chrome:** tab labels and masthead `metaValue` use skeleton placeholders while counts
  pending; do not show `Mark all as read` until counts are loaded. When the active filter’s rows are
  empty but empty-state copy depends on `subscriptions === 0` vs “all caught up”, show a row
  skeleton until counts resolve.
- Optimistic read updates must touch both latest feed item caches and the counts cache key (see
  `read-optimistic.ts`).
- **Loader cache priming:** on navigation, `await ensureQueryData` for the critical feed and
  `getLatestFeedCounts` in parallel. On link-hover preload, `void prefetchQuery` both without
  awaiting.

### Discover: critical shell + deferred rails

Discover defers **All publications** (and topic chips) via `DeferredMount`. Masthead, Recommended,
Social proof, and Trending load in the route loader on navigation.

| Tier                      | Server fn                                       | What loads                                | When                                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical (navigation)** | `getDiscoverExtras` + `getTrendingPublications` | Masthead, Recommended rail, Trending list | Route loader `await ensureQueryData`        |
| **Critical (preload)**    | same                                            | same keys                                 | Route loader `void prefetchQuery`           |
| **Deferred**              | topics + directory page                         | Topic chips, All publications             | `DeferredMount` + client `useSuspenseQuery` |

Implementation notes:

- One extras round trip shares `trendingPublicationUris` + `effectiveFollowUris` across both rails.
- **Do not** put `aria-busy="true"` on deferred section skeletons — they must stay off the perf
  ready chain (`perf/lib/measure.ts`). Directory skeletons follow the same rule.
- **Loader cache priming:** kick off all discover queries in the route loader. **Navigation:**
  `await ensureQueryData` for extras and trending (above the fold); `void prefetchQuery` for topics
  and default directory (below fold / `DeferredMount`). **Link-hover preload:** `void prefetchQuery`
  for everything — no awaits.
- **Client queries:** extras and trending use loader-seeded cache (`useSuspenseQuery` / `useQuery`) —
  do not re-defer them with skeleton toggles or `DeferredMount` after the loader awaits them.

### Server data: one round trip for the active view

For routes with tabs/search-driven views, prefer **one server fn** that returns shared metadata
(counts) plus the **active tab’s first page**, then seed per-query React Query caches from that
response (see `getTagPage` + `seedTagPageCaches`). Wire the route loader with `loaderDeps` on the
search params that change the fetch (`view`, `sort`, etc.) and a sensible `staleTime`.

Do **not** mount inactive tabs’ `useQuery` hooks — hidden tab panels still mount in the DOM, so an
enabled query on the inactive panel duplicates server work on every load. Only render the active
panel’s content (or pass `enabled: false` until selected).

### Lazy prefetch of inactive tabs

After the active view finishes loading, **`requestIdleCallback`**-prefetch the inactive tab’s
query into the same cache keys the panel will use. Wait until `useRouterState(… isLoading)` is false
so prefetch does not compete with the critical path. Pattern: `_layout.latest.tsx` (all filters),
`_layout.tag.$tag.tsx` (articles ↔ publications).

Skip idle prefetch when it would fire expensive unrelated work (e.g. signed-out Latest does not
prefetch every filter).

### Loading UX on tab switches

- **Delayed skeleton:** wait **150ms** before showing a skeleton (`useDelayedLoading` in
  `_layout.tag.$tag.tsx`). If data arrives within the grace period, never show skeleton — avoids
  flash on fast loads and prefetched tabs.
- **During the grace period:** keep static chrome visible; use a minimal `aria-busy` placeholder,
  not the empty state.
- **Skeleton scope:** skeleton replaces **rows/content only**, not page chrome. Example: publications
  tab keeps the “All publications” `SectionHead` and sort/layout controls mounted; only the
  directory grid/list skeletons below.
- **Revisits:** rely on React Query cache + prefetch — do not show loading again when cached data
  exists. Do not key skeleton off loader-populated cache checks alone (loaders seed cache before
  paint, so that always reads “cached”).
- **Optimistic tab UI:** set local `pendingView` on tab click and drive `Tabs selectedKey` from
  `pendingView ?? view`; clear when `isLoading` becomes false.
- **Load-more** pagination may show skeleton immediately (no delay) — only initial tab loads use
  the grace period.

### Perf test “ready” signal

Playwright perf tests wait for `[data-app-scroller]` and `aria-busy='true'` to clear
(`perf/lib/measure.ts`). Skeletons and loading placeholders must use `aria-busy="true"` until
content is ready.

## Linting & formatting (oxc + oxfmt)

Linting uses [oxlint](https://oxc.rs) (pinned `oxlint@1.48.0`) and formatting uses
[oxfmt](https://oxc.rs). This setup mirrors the `~/Documents/at-store` project.

- `.oxlintrc.json` — root config: `extends` the shared base + overrides, turns the broad
  `correctness` category `off` (rules are opted into explicitly), declares `jsPlugins`, and sets
  the import-x TypeScript resolver. Ignore globs cover generated/build output
  (`routeTree.gen.ts`, `dist`, `.output`, `.tanstack`, etc.).
- `config/oxlint/rules-base.json` — framework-agnostic base: ESLint core correctness rules,
  `eslint-comments`, `import-x`, `unicorn`, and `perfectionist/sort-imports`.
- `config/oxlint/overrides.json` — type-aware `@typescript-eslint`, `jsx-a11y`, React /
  react-hooks, and **`@stylexjs/eslint-plugin`** rules for `*.ts`/`*.tsx`, a Node env override for
  `*.mjs`/`*.cjs`, and a general `*.js`/`*.ts`/`*.tsx` block (import hygiene +
  `@stylistic/spaced-comment`).
  > Adapted from at-store: at-store-specific file lists/lexicons were dropped and the
  > import-resolution allowlist targets this repo's `#/` and `@/` aliases.
- **StyleX-aware linting (mirrors at-store).** The `*.ts`/`*.tsx` override adds
  `"jsPlugins": ["@stylexjs/eslint-plugin"]` and enables `@stylexjs/valid-styles` (with
  `propLimits` forcing `transitionDuration`/`animationDuration` to the `animationDuration.*`
  tokens), `sort-keys`, `valid-shorthands`, `enforce-extension`, `no-unused`,
  `no-legacy-contextual-styles`, and `no-lookahead-selectors`. Per-file override blocks switch off
  `enforce-extension` for the `*.stylex.tsx` token files and `valid-styles` /
  `no-legacy-contextual-styles` for the design-system components that legitimately need raw values
  / contextual selectors (see the file list in `overrides.json`).
- `.oxfmtrc.json` — oxfmt config: 2-space indent, 80 col, semicolons, double quotes,
  trailing commas (`all`), `lf`. Ignores generated files and lockfiles.
- **The design system is linted and formatted** (no longer excluded). `pnpm lint` runs over the
  whole repo incl. `src/design-system/` (0 errors). Because it's copy-and-own, a few violations in
  the pristine hip-ui copy were fixed in place (e.g. `video/index.tsx`: `transitionDuration` now
  uses `animationDuration.default`, and `.filter()` callbacks are wrapped).
- oxlint JS plugins in use (devDependencies): `@eslint-community/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments`,
  `eslint-plugin-perfectionist`, `@stylistic/eslint-plugin`, `@stylexjs/eslint-plugin`. The
  StyleX key-sort autofix (`eslint.stylex-autofix.mjs`, run via `pnpm fix-stylex-keys`) also needs
  `eslint` + `@typescript-eslint/parser`.
- App source is clean (`pnpm lint` → 0 errors, `pnpm format:check` passes). Note the
  `unicorn/no-typeof-undefined` rule: use `globalThis.localStorage === undefined`, not
  `typeof ... === "undefined"`, and `charSet: "utf8"` (not `"utf-8"`) in route `head`.

## Environment variables

- No environment variables are required to run the blank starter.
- When you add config, follow TanStack Start's env model: only variables prefixed with `VITE_`
  are exposed to client code; everything else stays server-only. `.env` / `.env.*` are gitignored
  (`.env.example` is allowed). For details load
  `@tanstack/start-client-core#start-core/execution-model`.

## Deployment notes

- `pnpm build` emits a Node server bundle at `dist/server/server.js` plus client assets in
  `dist/client/`.
- TanStack Start supports Cloudflare Workers, Netlify, Vercel, Node/Docker, Bun, and Railway. The
  default toolchain produces a Node server output; choose/configure a target before deploying. Load
  `@tanstack/start-client-core#start-core/deployment` for target-specific guidance.

## Key architectural decisions

- Kept the CLI default toolchain (Vite) and the generated structure unchanged; switched the
  package manager from npm to pnpm (lockfile is `pnpm-lock.yaml`, pinned via `packageManager`).
- Merged the CLI output into the pre-existing repo rather than scaffolding into a subfolder; the
  TanStack-specific `.gitignore` entries were appended to the repo's existing generic `.gitignore`.
- `vite.config.ts` plugin order matters: `stylexPlugin()` runs first, then `devtools()`, and
  `tanstackStart()` precedes `viteReact()`.
- **Removed Tailwind** in favor of StyleX + the hip-ui design system: dropped the Tailwind deps and
  Vite plugin, reduced `styles.css` to a reset, wired `@stylexjs/unplugin`, and rebuilt
  `__root.tsx`, `Header`, `Footer`, `ThemeToggle`, and the route pages on design-system components.

## Known gotchas

- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is auto-generated and gitignored; it is created on the first `dev`/`build`.
  Don't edit it or commit it. It is marked read-only in `.vscode/settings.json`.
- `dev` uses port 3000 but will hop to the next free port if it's occupied — check the startup log
  for the actual URL.
- Devtools code is automatically removed from production builds by `@tanstack/devtools-vite`.
- Path aliases `#/*` and `@/*` both map to `./src/*` (see `tsconfig.json` and `package.json#imports`).

## Next steps

- `pnpm dev` and start editing `src/routes/index.tsx`.
- Before architectural or library-specific changes, consult the TanStack Intent skills: run
  `npx @tanstack/intent@latest list` then `npx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>`.
- Add routes under `src/routes/`; add server logic with `createServerFn` / route `server` handlers.
- Author tests (Vitest) as features land; pick and configure a deployment target.
