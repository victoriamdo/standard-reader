# Railway deployment inspection (Standard Reader)

Inspect the live Railway deployment using the Railway CLI. The CLI is the
source of truth for deployment state — never guess from `railway.json` files
alone (they describe intent; the CLI shows reality).

## Standard Reader Railway topology

The `standard-reader` Railway project runs four long-lived services plus an
hourly cron, sharing a single Neon Postgres read-model. GitHub auto-deploys on
push to `main`. Every service uses the `RAILPACK` builder.

| Service          | Start command                                      | Config file            | Healthcheck / notes                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `web`            | `pnpm start` (= `node .output/server/index.mjs`)  | `railway.json`         | `/api/auth/atproto/metadata.json`; pre-deploy runs `pnpm db:migrate`; custom domain `standard-reader.app` |
| `tap`            | `ghcr.io/.../tap` Docker image on a `/data` volume | (Docker, no railpack)  | Long-running firehose consumer; admin API on `:2480` (private)         |
| `ingest`         | `pnpm ingest:start` (= `tsx src/server/ingest/service.ts`) | `railway.ingest.json`  | Binds `[::]:3099`; consumes `tap.railway.internal:2480`               |
| `recompute-cron` | `node scripts/recompute-cron.mjs`                 | `railway.cron.json`    | `0 * * * *`; POSTs the ingest worker's `/api/ingest/recompute`; `restartPolicyType: NEVER` |
| `claudeslop`     | `pnpm --filter claudeslop-labeler start`           | `services/claudeslop/railway.json` | `/health` (may not yet be deployed — see TODO.md)            |
| `botlabeler`     | `pnpm --filter botlabeler start`                   | `services/botlabeler/railway.json` | `/health` (sidecar labeler)                                  |

**Runbook gotcha:** Railway auto-detects only the root `railway.json`. Every
non-web service needs its **Config File Path** set explicitly (Dashboard →
service → Settings → Config-as-code, or `serviceInstanceUpdate{
railwayConfigFile }` via the GraphQL API) to `railway.ingest.json` /
`railway.cron.json` / `services/<svc>/railway.json`. Without it Railway silently
falls back to the web build — the #1 cause of "wrong service deployed" bugs.

Shared secrets to be aware of (don't print values): `INGEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` =
`TAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`; `PUBLIC_URL=https://standard-reader.app`;
`ATPROTO_PRIVATE_KEY_JWK` is the ES256 OAuth signing key. Honeycomb
(`HONEYCOMB_API_KEY`) is the primary observability layer — Railway has no log
drain, so structured events forward to Honeycomb from `web` + `ingest`.

## Prerequisites

The Railway CLI must be installed and linked to this project.

```bash
# Verify CLI is present
railway --version

# If missing, install (macOS)
brew install railway

# Authenticate (opens browser) — or use --browserless for SSH sessions
railway login

# Link this directory to the standard-reader project + environment
# (interactive: pick the project and environment when prompted)
railway link
```

For CI / non-interactive use, set `RAILWAY_TOKEN` (project-level) or
`RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` (account-level) instead of `railway login`.

The repo root is already linked (a `.railway` directory may exist). If
`railway status` reports the wrong project/environment, re-run `railway link`.

## Inspection workflow

Run these in order. Start broad (project overview), then narrow to the failing
service and deployment. Default to `--json` when you'll parse output, plain
output when a human will read it.

### 1. Project overview — what's deployed and is it healthy?

```bash
railway status
# Human-readable: workspace, project, environment, every resource with
# deployment status + replica counts + regions.

railway status --json
# Same payload as raw JSON — use when parsing.
```

`railway status` groups resources by type (Services, Databases, Volumes, Cron
jobs, Buckets). For each service it shows the latest deployment status and
replica count. This is the fastest "is anything broken?" check — run it first.

### 2. Recent deployments — what happened lately?

```bash
railway deployment list
# Lists deployments with IDs, statuses, and timestamps for the linked service.

# Target a specific service without relinking:
railway deployment list -s ingest
railway deployment list -s web
railway deployment list -s tap
railway deployment list -s recompute-cron
```

Deployment statuses you'll see:

| Status         | Meaning                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUCCESS`      | Deployed and running                                          |
| `FAILED`       | Build or deploy failed                                        |
| `CRASHED`      | Started then crashed — check deploy logs                      |
| `BUILDING`     | Railpack build in progress                                    |
| `DEPLOYING`    | Built; container starting up                                  |
| `INITIALIZING` | Container starting                                           |
| `WAITING` / `QUEUED` | Pending capacity                                         |
| `REMOVING` / `REMOVED` | Tearing down / gone                                      |

A `CRASHED` or `FAILED` status means step 3 next, scoped to that service.

### 3. Logs — stream or fetch historical

`railway logs` shows deploy logs (app stdout/stderr) from the most recent
**successful** deployment by default. Use flags to retarget.

```bash
# Stream the latest deployment's deploy logs (Ctrl-C to stop)
railway logs --latest

# Last N lines, historical (no streaming)
railway logs -n 200

# Since / until windows (historical fetch mode)
railway logs --since 1h
railway logs --since 30m --until 10m

# A specific deployment (grab ID from `railway deployment list`)
railway logs 7422c95b-c604-46bc-9de4-b7a43e1fd53d

# A specific service (without relinking)
railway logs -s ingest --latest
railway logs -s web -n 100

# Build logs (failed build → look here first)
railway logs -s web --build
railway logs -s ingest --build --latest

# HTTP logs (request-level: method, path, status, duration, request ID)
railway logs -s web --http -n 50

# Machine-readable for parsing
railway logs -s ingest -n 100 --json
```

Log type flags (`--deployment` default, `--build`, `--http`, `--network`) are
mutually exclusive. With no `--lines`/`--since`/`--until`, `railway logs`
**streams in real time** over a WebSocket — pass any of those flags to switch
to historical fetch mode instead.

### 4. Variables — confirm runtime config

Never print secret values back to the user. Use this only to confirm a key is
*set* (presence check), and reference env var names rather than values.

```bash
# List variable KEYS for the linked service (mask values when showing output)
railway variable list -s web
railway variable list -s ingest
```

If a deploy is misbehaving, check that these are present and correct:

- `web`: `DATABASE_URL`, `PUBLIC_URL` (= `https://standard-reader.app`),
  `ATPROTO_PRIVATE_KEY_JWK`, `HONEYCOMB_API_KEY`, `HONEYCOMB_DATASET`,
  `INGEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `TAP_API_URL` (= `http://tap.railway.internal:2480`)
- `ingest`: `DATABASE_URL`, `INGEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `TAP_API_URL`,
  `TAP_LABELER_API_URL`, `HONEYCOMB_API_KEY`, `INGEST_PORT` (= `3099`)
- `tap`: `TAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (must equal `INGEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET`),
  `TAP_SIGNAL_COLLECTION`, `TAP_COLLECTION_FILTERS`, `TAP_DATABASE_URL`
- `recompute-cron`: `INGEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `INGEST_PORT` / service URL for
  the POST target

### 5. Drilling into a running service

```bash
# SSH into the running container (interactive shell — for live debugging)
railway ssh -s ingest

# Resource + HTTP metrics for a service
railway metrics -s web

# Database shell (if the service has a database resource)
railway connect
```

`railway ssh` is the fastest way to inspect a running container's filesystem,
env, or process tree. Copy the exact `railway ssh ...` command from the
dashboard (right-click a service → "Copy SSH Command") if the CLI defaults
target the wrong service.

## Triage patterns

### "The latest deploy failed"

1. `railway deployment list -s <service>` → grab the top deployment ID + status.
2. If `FAILED` or `BUILDING` (stuck): `railway logs -s <service> --build --latest`.
   Look for build errors (Railpack, `pnpm build`, missing deps).
3. If `CRASHED`: `railway logs -s <service> --latest -n 200`. The container
   started then died — look for the startup error (missing env, port bind
   failure, missing `.output/server/index.mjs` on `web`).

### "web is returning 5xx / users see errors"

1. `railway logs -s web --http -n 100` → spot the failing paths/status codes.
   Each line has a `request_id`.
2. `railway logs -s web --since 15m` → correlate deploy-log lines around the
   same timestamps as the HTTP errors.
3. If the failures started after a deploy, compare the deployment ID from
   `railway deployment list -s web` against when errors began.

### "ingest worker not updating the read-model"

1. `railway status` → confirm `ingest` shows `SUCCESS` with replicas > 0.
2. `railway logs -s ingest -n 200` → look for tap WebSocket disconnects,
   backfill errors, or DB write failures.
3. Check `tap` is healthy too: `railway logs -s tap -n 100`. The ingest worker
   can't make progress if tap isn't delivering events.
4. Hit the ingest admin endpoint over private networking (from `web` or a
   sandbox): `GET /api/ingest/status` (Basic auth `admin:$INGEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
   on `http://ingest.railway.internal:3099`.

### "recompute cron didn't fire"

1. `railway status` → find the `recompute-cron` cron job entry (shows schedule
   + next run time).
2. `railway deployment list -s recompute-cron` → its deployments are individual
   executions; a `FAILED` entry means the run errored.
3. `railway logs -s recompute-cron --latest` → the run's stdout/stderr.

### "Wrong service got deployed (config-file-path gotcha)"

Symptom: `ingest` or `recompute-cron` is running the `web` build (look for
`node .output/server/index.mjs` in `tap`/`ingest` logs, or a missing `tsx`
startup line).

Cause: Railway fell back to the root `railway.json` because the service's
Config File Path wasn't set. Fix via Dashboard → service → Settings →
Config-as-code → set to `railway.ingest.json` / `railway.cron.json` /
`services/<svc>/railway.json`, then redeploy. This is the documented runbook
gotcha — check it first whenever a non-web service looks like `web`.

## When to stop using the CLI

- **Honeycomb for app-level behavior:** Railway shows deploy/HTTP logs; for
  structured traces, slow-endpoint P99s, and ingest health over time, query
  Honeycomb (`HONEYCOMB_DATASET=standard-reader`). Railway has no log drain, so
  Honeycomb is the durable observability store.
- **Neon for DB issues:** if logs point at the database, use the `neon-postgres`
  skill — don't `railway connect` to a Railway-hosted DB (ours is on Neon).
- **Deploys / config changes:** this skill is read-only inspection. For
  `railway up`, `railway redeploy`, `railway variable set`, or editing
  `railway.json`, surface the intent to the user first and let them confirm —
  don't mutate production without explicit approval.
