 *
 * `labelerSubscription` (the flat NSID) is the original published collection;
 * `labelerSubscriptionV2` (`app.standard-reader.labeler.subscription`) is the
 * successor, nested under the `labeler` NSID group so a single
 * `_lexicon.labeler.standard-reader.app` DNS record covers the whole family
 * (`labeler.defs`, `labeler.service`, `labeler.subscription`). New writes go
 * to V2; reads accept both until per-reader migration completes (see the lazy
 * migration on the labeler write path). The flat NSID stays published for
 * backwards compatibility with already-authorized sessions and existing repo
 * records until Phase 2 deprecation.
