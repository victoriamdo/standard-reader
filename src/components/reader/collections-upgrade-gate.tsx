 * optimistically in `upgradeToCollections` before the re-auth completes — the
 * granted scope is the source of truth for "the PDS has authorized this".
 *

 * revoked on the PDS, or the flag was set but re-auth never finished) are
 * re-prompted here instead of being sent to a builder whose writes will fail.
