## Single purpose description

Standard Reader is a browser companion for the Standard Reader web app
(standard-reader.app) and the standard.site reading network. Its sole purpose
is to help signed-in users save articles, follow publications, and open the
reader from pages they visit — including a popup, page overlay, context menu,
and Bluesky embed save buttons on supported sites.

---

## Permission justifications

Paste each block into the matching field on the Privacy practices tab.

### activeTab

When you click the extension icon or use a context-menu action, we read the
active tab’s URL (and optional discovery metadata from the page) to determine
whether the page matches an indexed standard.site article or publication, then
show save/follow/open actions. We do not access tab content beyond the URL and
discovery hints needed for matching.

### tabs

We query tab URLs to update the toolbar badge when you switch tabs, resolve
the current page for the popup, open Standard Reader after save/follow actions,
and close the OAuth login tab after sign-in. Tab access is limited to these
user-initiated reading and account flows.

### contextMenus

Right-click menu items let you save a link or the current page to Standard
Reader, or open a matched article in the reader, without opening the popup first.
The menu only appears for actions relevant to Standard Reader.

### cookies

After you sign in on standard-reader.app, the extension reads your existing
HttpOnly session cookie on that domain so API requests are authenticated with
the same account as the website. We do not use cookies for tracking; there is
no separate extension login.

### storage

User preferences (page overlay on/off, Bluesky embed save button on/off) are
stored locally in chrome.storage.sync so settings persist across browser
sessions. No account credentials are stored in extension storage.

### Host permission use

**standard-reader.app** — Extension API calls (resolve, save, follow, session)
and OAuth sign-in flow.

**bsky.app** — Inject save buttons on standard.site article embeds inside the
Bluesky web app when that feature is enabled in options.

**&lt;all_urls&gt;** — Content scripts run on pages you visit to (1) show an
optional save/open overlay on publication websites, (2) read page URLs and
lightweight discovery hints for index matching, and (3) support context-menu
actions on links. Only URLs and hints are sent to our server; page text is not
uploaded. The overlay is disabled on standard-reader.app itself and can be
turned off in extension options.

### Remote code use

The extension does not load or execute remote code. All JavaScript, HTML, and
CSS are bundled in the published package (Manifest V3). Network requests to
standard-reader.app return JSON API data only; no scripts are downloaded or
evaluated at runtime.

## Data use (questionnaire guidance)

When the dashboard asks what data you collect, align with
[`privacy-policy.md`](./privacy-policy.md):

| Data | Collected? | Notes |
| ---- | ---------- | ----- |
| **Website content / URLs** | Yes | Page and link URLs sent to `/api/extension/*` for index matching only |
| **Authentication info** | Yes | Session cookie on standard-reader.app (existing web login) |
| **User activity** | Yes | Save/follow actions you explicitly trigger (written to your AT Protocol repo) |
| **Personally identifiable information** | Via account | Same account as the web app when signed in |
| **Health / financial / personal communications** | No | |
| **Location** | No | |
| **Web history browsing** | No | URLs are processed for matching on demand; we do not build a browsing history log in the extension |

**Purpose:** App functionality (save, follow, open reader).

**Shared with third parties:** No sale or sharing of extension data for advertising.

**Encryption in transit:** Yes (HTTPS to standard-reader.app).
