# Standard Reader

> A warm, editorial reader for [standard.site](https://standard.site) publications on the
> AT Protocol (the Atmosphere). Like a classic RSS reader, but built around **discovery** —
> helping you find the publications you aren't following yet.

Instead of polling RSS/Atom feeds, a "publication" is a set of signed records in an
author-controlled AT Proto repository. Any reader that understands the schema can render any
publication, so the directory of all known publications is just a query — not a walled garden.
Standard Reader makes that literal: a [tap](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo) instance
backfills all `standard.site` data off the network into a Neon Postgres read-model, powering
feeds, search, trending, and network-wide recommendations. Your personal state (follows, likes,
read/unread, publication lists) is written back to **your** repo as records — owned by you,
cached by us.

For the full product vision (screens, data model, discovery engine), see
[`APP_VISION.md`](./APP_VISION.md). The actionable roadmap lives in [`TODO.md`](./TODO.md).

## Stack

- **Framework:** [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) + TanStack Router
  (file-based routing), React 19, Vite.
- **UI:** [hip-ui](https://hip-ui.tngl.io) design system (copy-and-own, react-aria) vendored in
  `src/design-system/`, styled with [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com) tokens — no Tailwind.
- **Data:** Neon Postgres read-model managed with [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team)
  (`src/db/`), fed by a tap instance + ingest worker; accessed via server functions.
- **AT Protocol:** [`@atcute/*`](https://github.com/mary-ext/atcute) clients,
  AT Proto / Bluesky OAuth login, app-owned `app.standard-reader.*` lexicons in `lexicons/`.
- **Tooling:** pnpm, oxlint + oxfmt, Vitest.

## Getting started

Requires Node ≥ 22.6 and pnpm (pinned via `package.json#packageManager`).

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in values — see comments in the file
pnpm dev               # http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

At minimum you need `DATABASE_URL` (a Neon Postgres connection string — a local Postgres works
too) and `PUBLIC_URL` (keep the default `http://127.0.0.1:3000` for local loopback OAuth; no
signing key needed in dev). Apply the schema with:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate   # or db:push for quick local iteration
```

### Ingestion (populating the read-model)

The app reads from Postgres; data gets there via a **tap** instance and a standalone ingest
worker:

1. Start tap — see [`tap/README.md`](./tap/README.md) (`docker compose up` in `tap/`, plus
   `seed-repos.sh` or dynamic repo tracking via `TAP_API_URL`).
2. Run the worker: `pnpm ingest:dev`. It consumes tap's acknowledged WebSocket channel, maps
   records to rows idempotently, and expands the tracked-repo set along the graph.

Without ingestion the app runs fine but the directory and feeds will be empty.

## Living docs

- [`APP_VISION.md`](./APP_VISION.md) — product vision: concept, screens, data model,
  architecture. Kept in sync with reality as decisions change.
- [`TODO.md`](./TODO.md) — the roadmap derived from the vision.
- [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) — repo conventions for AI agents (design-system rules, lint setup,
  gotchas).
- [`packages/README.md`](./packages/README.md) — the document renderer family: the
  framework-agnostic core and the per-framework renderers built on it.
