/**
 * A small, explainable AI-writing detector.
 *
 * This is deliberately heuristic — no model, no network, no native deps — so it
 * runs anywhere and you can read exactly why a document was flagged. It blends a
 * handful of well-worn signals that tend to separate generic LLM prose from
 * human writing:
 *
 *   - burstiness     humans vary sentence length a lot; LLMs are evener
 *   - clichés        "delve into", "in today's fast-paced world", "tapestry", …
 *   - transitions    heavy "moreover / furthermore / additionally" scaffolding
 *   - hedging        "it's important to note", "it's worth noting", …
 *   - em-dashes      LLMs lean on the em-dash far more than most writers
 *   - lexical variety very uniform vocabulary reads more synthetic
 *
 * Each signal contributes 0..1; the weighted blend is the final score. None of
 * this is authoritative — it is a vibe check, and it says so on the tin.
